ArchiveFacebook is a Firefox extension, which helps you to save web pages from Facebook and easily manage them. Save content from Facebook directly to your hard drive and view them exactly the same way you currently view them on Facebook.

Why would you want to do this? Facebook has become a very important part of our lives. Information about our friends, family, business contacts and acquaintances is stored in Facebook with no easy way to get it out. ArchiveFacebook allows you to do just that. What guarantee do you have that Facebook won't accidentally, or in some cases intentionally delete your account? Don't trust your data to one web site alone. Take matters into your own hands and preserve this information. Show it to your kids one day!

Currently ArchiveFacebook can save your:

* Photos

* Activity Stream

* Friends List

* Notes

* Events

* Info
